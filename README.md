# Scala-Coursera

This is my work on the Coursera course on Scala. I am trying to follow the complete [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)
I have been working as a Scala developer for about 9 months now so I have rushed the exercises for the first 2 parts of the specialisation, this is because I wanted to complete them to ensure I had a complete foundation in the language but the actual coding challenges I found weren't challenging enough to warrant taking the time to write code I am particularly proud of.

Hopefully I'll write better code for the final 3 parts of the course.
