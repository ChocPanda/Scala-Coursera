# Scala-Coursera

This is my work on the Coursera course on Scala. I am trying to follow the complete [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)
I have been working as a Scala developer since Nov 2016 and am loving functional programming since coming from a C# and C++ background.

You can find my certifcates so far on the course:
* [Part 1, Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/8HNVL9B9FX4L)
* [Part 2, Functional Program Design in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/38VPPALFZ97N)

Hopefully I'll have the final 3 parts done soon
